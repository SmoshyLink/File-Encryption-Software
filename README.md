# File Encryption Software

A project for the CMPS 283 (Computer and Information Security) course at AUB.

This software encrypts or decrypts a plain text file, Word document, or JPEG image with either DES, RSA, or AES. Developed with Python.

In order to run the software, simply download all of the files in the repository in to the same directory, and open gui.py with the Python interpreter.

For example,

```python gui.py```

Python 3.6 or higher is required.
